        "Pulmonary tuberculosis is an infectious disease and spreads mainly by airborne droplet nuclei. Sputum positive pulmonary TB patients are the main source of infection. It is estimated that an untreated smear positive pulmonary TB patient infects 10-15 persons annually. Therefore, it is very important to identify TB suspects and diagnose them early in order to effectively treat and make them non infectious.",

        "",
        "* Most patients with TB visit health facilities promptly after symptoms occur. Hence, every adult patient with respiratory symptoms attending the health facility must be asked about symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis.",
        "* The most common symptom of pulmonary TB is a persistent cough for 3 weeks or more, usually with expectoration. It may be accompanied by one or more symptoms such as weight loss, chest pain, tiredness, shortness of breath, fever, particularly with rise of temperature in the evening; in some cases there will be blood in the sputum, loss of appetite, and night sweats.",
        "* About 2-3% of new adult outpatients in a general health facility are expected to have cough for 3 weeks or more, and on an average 10% of the suspects are expected to have sputum positive pulmonary TB.",
        "",
        "**CASE FINDING TOOLS:**",
        "",
        "The main tools for diagnosing pulmonary TB are sputum smear microscopy, chest X-ray, and culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli.",
        "",
        "* **Sputum smear microscopy:** This can be used for diagnosis, monitoring and defining cure and is the key diagnostic tool used for case detection in RNTCP. If good diagnostic practices are followed, it is expected that at least 50% of the new pulmonary TB patients diagnosed will be smear-positive.",
        "* **Chest X-ray:** No shadow is typical of TB; 10-15% culture-positive cases remain undiagnosed and 40% patients diagnosed as having TB by X-ray alone may not have active TB disease. It is supportive to microscopy.",
        "* **Culture:** Culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli is very sensitive and specific but is expensive as it requires a specialized laboratory set-up and results are available only after several weeks. Culture and sensitivity testing is valuable for diagnosis and management of drug resistant tuberculosis, besides epidemiological surveillance and planning.",
        "* **Tuberculin test:** Tuberculin test may be useful as an additional tool for diagnosing \"Pediatric\" TB, in whom a positive test is more likely to reflect recent infection with TB and it, indicates a much higher risk of developing disease. However, the tuberculin test has no role in diagnosing adult pulmonary TB disease in India.",
